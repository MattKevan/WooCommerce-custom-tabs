# WooCommerce custom product tabs

A simple plugin to manage and add custom tabs on a WooCommerce product page. Tab content can be added using the block editor and supports any block or content that the editor supports, though some elements might not be relevant. Currently changes are applied to every product.

## Features

* Add and edit custom product tabs.
* Draggable admin interface to reorder tabs.
* Toggle tab visibility, showing or hiding tabs as required.

## Future ideas for development

* Add ability to create tab groups and apply them to specific products or product categories.
